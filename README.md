Brandify: AI-Powered Branding Strategy Application
Brandify is an innovative application powered by AI, designed to provide comprehensive recommendations and guidance for branding strategies. This repository contains three AI models integrated into our web app:

Speech-to-Text Model: Utilizes Transformer's Speech2TextProcessor and Speech2TextForConditionalGeneration to convert speech input into text, facilitating seamless interaction with the application.
NLP-Driven Branding Strategy Tool: This model specializes in generating product names and color palettes tailored to enhance brand visibility and appeal within the corporate landscape, empowering businesses to formulate effective branding strategies.
Text-to-Speech Model: Takes the output from the branding strategy tool and transforms it into speech using SpeechT5Processor, SpeechT5ForTextToSpeech, and SpeechT5HifiGan. The set_seed function ensures reproducibility in the model's results.
All three models have undergone thorough testing within this notebook and are ready for deployment in our web application.
